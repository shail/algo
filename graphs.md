# Graphs

- Graphs are more complicated than trees. They consist of nodes that have 0, 1, or several pointers to other
  nodes. Unlike in a tree, many elements may point to the same node, possibly creating a loop. The links
  themselves may have values or weights. These links are called edges because they may have more information
  than just a pointer.In graphs, the edges can be one-way or two-way. A graph with one-way edges is called a
  directed graph, while a graph with two-way pointers is called an undirected graph. Graphs are commonly used
  to model real-world problems that are difficult to model with other data structures. A directed graph could
  represent aqueducts connecting cities. There are many ways to represent graph data structures in code,
  choice of representation is often determined by the algorithm being implemented. Graphs are often used in
  real-world programming.
